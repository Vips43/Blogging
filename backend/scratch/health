By reducing production lead times for U.S. data center operators, this strategic capability expansion enhances the company's capacity to meet the growing demands of the power infrastructure in the AI era. The facility's 134,000 square foot dedicated capacity aligns with the opening of a 400,000-square-foot Flex manufacturing facility in Dallas, Texas. By focusing on critical power products, both locations enable faster, scale production for an expanding clientele in the U.S.The factors driving the market include:Rising Demand for Medical Devices in Emerging Economies: Emerging markets are seeing increased healthcare investments, aging populations and growing middle-class incomes. This drives demand for medical devices, prompting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to rely on contract manufacturers to efficiently meet volume and cost requirements.Integration of Robotics and Automation in Manufacturing: Advanced robotics and automation improve precision, speed and consistency in medical device production. Contract manufacturers adopting these technologies can offer high-quality, scalable solutions that attract OEM partnerships.Technological Advances in Medical Devices: Innovations such as miniaturization, smart sensors, and wireless connectivity require specialized manufacturing capabilities. Contract manufacturers with expertise in handling complex technologies are increasingly in demand to support these evolving product designs.Request a sample copy of the global market for contract manufacturing of medical devices.Report SynopsisReport MetricDetailsBase year considered2024Forecast period considered2025-2030Full story available on Benzinga.com","content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","keywords":["health care","economics","press releases"],"creator":["globe newswire"],"language":"english","country":["united states of america"],"category":["health"],"datatype":"news","pubDate":"2026-02-11 15:17:39","pubDateTZ":"UTC","fetched_at":"2026-02-11 15:32:03","image_url":null,"video_url":null,"source_id":"benzinga","source_name":"Benzinga","source_priority":2050,"source_url":"https://www.benzinga.com","source_icon":"https://n.bytvi.com/benzinga.png","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_summary":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","duplicate":false},{"article_id":"f534c8edffe69e85a58fb40638ead60b","link":"https://www.news9live.com/health/health-news/can-epilepsy-be-controlled-neurologist-weighs-in-2929402","title":"Can epilepsy be controlled?
